<code>
    const textContent = "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,..."

    const action = () =>{
        console.log("action to botton")
    }

    <CardAnimated title="something title" content={textContent} textButton="LEARN MORE" buttonAction={action}/>
